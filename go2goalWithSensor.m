%Create the maze and load parameters such as the start position (sPos),
%goal position (gPos). The matrix named 'Z' corresponds to the map but is
%flipped, a good idea is to compare Z with the maze to understand how it is
%flipped. Also, notice that sPos(2) and gPos(2) corresponds to the x
%positions and sPos(1) and gPos(1) are the y positions..
